		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			Hi, my name is Hugo, aka Hugos68. I could bore you with some AI generated paragraph about myself but I wont.
			I enjoy contributing to Open Source Software and currently am working on <a href="https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton" target="_blank">Skeleton</a> at Skeleton Labs.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm currently in my 4th year of my bachelors in computer science. I'm fluent in TypeScript, Svelte, Java, C# and Go.
			If you're interested in hiring feel free to contact me, whether that's through Github, E-mail, Discord or any other platform.
